## HEY FRIEND

Thanks for coming to check out my slide deck. 

Special thanks to @codepo8 who designed the slideshow deck foundation

Type is Alef for body text and Tauri for headings.

Apologies that I don't know the source of all the gifs and images I used. I found them scattered across Imgur and all sorts of animation-aggregate tumblrs with technology themes. Thanks to you, if you made one of them. <3

Cheers,

- Angelina
